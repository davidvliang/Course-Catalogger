An application that lets you know which rooms are open at which time of day.

## organizer.py
Main line of effort. 

```
# perform update 
    > python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
# install required libraries using template command
    > python3 -m pip install [LIBRARY] --user

#### Thoughts
 - Create a Search box that allows you to search courses based on keywords in any field
 - Create Filter options to narrow down search results based on field
 - Create GUI to see which classes are open at which times (I'm thinking like outlook scheduling assistant format)
 - Learn Webscraping concepts to parse through main page and each subject's page
