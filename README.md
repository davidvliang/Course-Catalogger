# Course-Catalogger

## Purpose 
Create a program that displays course information with much more dynamic features and utilities.

## Great Goals
 - Create a Search box that allows you to search courses based on keywords in any field
 - Create Filter options to narrow down search results based on field
 - Create GUI to see which classes are open at which times (I'm thinking like outlook scheduling assistant format)
 - Learn Webscraping concepts to parse through main page and each subject's page
